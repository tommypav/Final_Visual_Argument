Creator’s Statement: Fast Fashion Visual Argument  

For this visual argument, I aimed to bring attention to the environmental impact of fast fashion. Using an image of a landfill overflowing with discarded clothing, accompanied by the phrase "Wear it, Toss it, Repeat," I wanted to provoke viewers to think critically about the wastefulness that fast fashion promotes. The purpose was to raise awareness and encourage a shift toward more sustainable choices by making the consequences of fast fashion visible and urgent.

In designing this visual, I considered my audience to be a general group of consumers, with a particular focus on younger viewers who might be drawn to fast fashion for its low prices and frequent trends. The context of this project is rooted in the increasing relevance of sustainable fashion, as awareness of environmental issues continues to grow. By targeting this audience and aligning the message with their values, I sought to make the argument both accessible and impactful.

To emphasize my message, I applied several design principles from my readings. First, contrast was essential in creating a visually striking image. The phrase "Wear it, Toss it, Repeat" stands out boldly against the muted background of the landfill, immediately capturing the viewer's attention. This contrast was critical in ensuring that the message felt urgent, drawing the audience directly to the repetitive and disposable nature of fast fashion.

Repetition was another core element. The phrase itself, "Wear it, Toss it, Repeat," serves as a critique of fast fashion’s cyclical, wasteful nature. By using a repetitive structure in the wording, I aimed to underscore the endless loop that the fast fashion industry creates—where clothes are bought, worn briefly, and discarded just as quickly. Visually, the image of clothing piling up in the landfill also reinforces this sense of repetition, mirroring the overconsumption encouraged by fast fashion.

Additionally, I paid close attention to proximity and alignment to create a cohesive design. I placed the phrase close to the clothing pile in the image, aligning the text centrally to ensure it felt connected to the visual. This alignment draws the viewer’s eye naturally from the message to the image, reinforcing the argument and making the overall composition feel unified.

Finally, I used pathos to evoke an emotional response. The overwhelming scale of waste in the image is meant to foster a sense of responsibility, making the consequences of fast fashion feel more immediate and personal. This emotional appeal aligns with my rhetorical goal of encouraging viewers to reflect on their own consumption habits and the impact these habits have on the planet. By showing the outcome of this disposable culture, I hoped to inspire a reconsideration of fast fashion’s true cost.

In summary, each design choice worked toward the goal of making viewers pause, reflect, and ultimately question their relationship with fashion. This project reflects my commitment to advocating for sustainable choices, using visual impact to challenge a wasteful system and promote a shift in consumer habits. Through contrast, repetition, alignment, and emotional appeal, I sought to create a compelling argument that prompts viewers to rethink the impact of their clothing purchases.
