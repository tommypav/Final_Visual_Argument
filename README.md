I wanted to create this visual argument to raise awareness about the 
environmental harm cause by fast fashion. The image of a landfill filled with
discarded clothing represents the wasteful cycle that fast fashion encourages.
I chose the phrase "Wear it, Toss it, Repeat" because it highligts how quickly
clothes are consumed and thrown away. By presenting this stark reality, I hope
to encourage a shift towards more sustainable fashion choices.
