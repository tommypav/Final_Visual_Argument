Creator’s Statement: How I Created the Fast Fashion Visual Argument  

For this visual argument, I began by selecting an impactful image I found online from the New York Times, showing a landfill filled with discarded clothing. This image powerfully represented the environmental consequences of fast fashion, which aligned well with my rhetorical goals of raising awareness and encouraging sustainable practices.

Once I had the image, I wanted to layer text on it to communicate the message clearly and directly. I decided on the phrase "Wear it, Toss it, Repeat" as the main text layer to highlight the repetitive, disposable cycle that fast fashion promotes. To ensure the text blended visually but remained readable, I used a dark blue for this phrase—a color that I selected directly from within the pile of clothes in the image. This choice created a sense of unity between the text and the image while still making the message stand out.

To reinforce the argument, I added a second layer of text with a key fact: "ONLY 1% OF CLOTHING IS RECYCLED INTO NEW GARMENTS." I used a bold yellow for this line, choosing a shade that would stand out against the background but also harmonize with the existing colors in the image. This fact served to emphasize the unsustainable nature of fast fashion and aimed to shock viewers into questioning their own consumption habits.

The design choices—from the color selections to the layered text and factual emphasis—were all crafted to make the message of this visual argument clear and impactful. Through this process, I was able to create a cohesive, visually compelling argument that aligns with my goals of encouraging viewers to rethink the impact of their clothing purchases.
